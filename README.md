# Stimulus

Is your furnace to slow? Sugar cane not growing fast enough?



Stimulate your blocks and make them work faster with the Stimulator.



This mod adds one item, the Stimulator.



All you have to do is [sneak] right click on a block to speed up the block ticks.



Includes configuration settings for tick speed, recipe, and durability.





**Warning:** Mods may respond badly if used on their blocks. This mod is not responsible for damage to your world if the item is used on a block that comes from another mod.
